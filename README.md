# Smart Resume Analyzer System

## 1. About the Dataset
This project focuses on developing a smart resume analyzer system to assist in job application processes. The dataset consists of resumes and job descriptions, which are used to perform SWOT (Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, Threats) analysis and provide improvement suggestions.

## 2. Objective
The primary objectives of this project are to:
- Develop a resume analyzer using the Mixtral-8x7b LLM on Groq for performing SWOT analysis and providing enhancement suggestions.
- Improve the match between candidates and job descriptions by analyzing resumes effectively.
- Create a user-friendly interface to interact with the resume analyzer system.

## 3. Approach
The project utilizes the following approach:
- **Integration for Enhanced Analysis:**
  - Integrated SerperDevTool and WebsiteSearchTool for comprehensive market research and detailed analysis.
- **Multi-Agent System:**
  - Engineered a multi-agent system using the Crew-AI framework:
    - **Job Researcher Agent:** Conducts research on job requirements and market trends.
    - **Resume SWOT Analyzer Agent:** Analyzes resumes using SWOT analysis to identify areas for improvement.
- **Semantic Matching:**
  - Used Sentence-BERT (S-BERT) for semantic matching between resumes and job descriptions.
  - Achieved a 30% increase in candidate-job fit by improving the relevance and accuracy of the matches.
- **User Interface:**
  - Developed a user interface using Streamlit to allow seamless resume input and output of detailed JSON reports.

## 4. Results & Key Features
- **Improved Fit:** Achieved a 30% increase in candidate-job fit through enhanced semantic matching and analysis.
- **User Interface:** Created a Streamlit-based interface for easy interaction with the resume analyzer, providing detailed JSON reports on resume analysis and improvement suggestions.
